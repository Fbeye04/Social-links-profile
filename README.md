### What I learned

- Mobile-First Workflow: This approach to web development prioritizes designing and developing for mobile devices first before scaling up to larger screens. The idea is to ensure that the core functionality and content are accessible on smaller screens, where constraints are tighter, and then progressively enhance the design for larger devices like tablets and desktops. This method promotes a better user experience for the majority of web traffic, which often comes from mobile users.

- Navigate Website Using Keyboard: Ensuring that your website is navigable via keyboard is crucial for accessibility. It allows users who cannot use a mouse, such as those with motor disabilities, to interact with your site. Key focus areas include making all interactive elements like links, buttons, and forms accessible through the keyboard using the Tab key and ensuring proper focus management. Implementing keyboard navigation improves usability and makes your website compliant with web accessibility standards.

- Semantic Elements: Semantic elements in HTML, such as <header>, <main>, <section>, and <footer>, clearly describe their meaning and purpose within the webpage. Using semantic elements helps structure your content in a meaningful way, making it more understandable for search engines and assistive technologies. This enhances both SEO and accessibility, ensuring that the content is presented logically and is easier to navigate.
